# Project Setup & Gesture Guide

This project allows you to control a presentation using hand gestures captured by your webcam. It uses computer vision to recognize specific hand poses to navigate slides, point, draw, and erase, offering an interactive and touch-free presentation experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Initialization & Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the required software and files set up.

### 1. Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python installed. You will also need to install the following libraries:

-   **OpenCV (`opencv-python`)**: Used to access the **camera** and process images.
-   **NumPy**: Used for creating and managing the **list** of finger states and other numerical operations.
-   **MediaPipe**: The core library for **hand gesture recognition**.

You can install all required libraries with a single command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe
```

## üìÅ Presentation Folder Setup

You must have a **folder containing your presentation slides**. Before running the program, export each slide as a separate image file in **JPG or PNG format** and place them all together in one directory. The program will load these images in alphanumeric order.

## üñêÔ∏è Gesture Guide

The control system works by identifying which of your fingers are extended. The state of your hand is read as a list of five numbers (`[0,0,0,0,0]`), where each number represents a finger.

-   **`1`** means the finger is **Open** (extended).
-   **`0`** means the finger is **Close** (curled).

The list index corresponds to your fingers as follows:

`[ 1:Thumb, 2:Index, 3:Middle, 4:Ring, 5:Pinkie ]`
